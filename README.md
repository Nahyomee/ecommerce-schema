# 🛒 Multi-Vendor eCommerce Database Schema for Laravel

A lot of times, I do a lot of ecommerce projects and I just thought I should create a ready-to-use database schema to make my work easier. I also thought to share it with others so it can help anyone who needs it. 

This repository contains a ready-to-use database schema for a **multi-vendor eCommerce platform**, built with Laravel migrations. It includes:

- Laravel migration files
- SQL dump
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Setup instructions
